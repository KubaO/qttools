Qt Linguist on a Wee Bit of Steroids
====================================

The purpose of this fork is to make Qt Linguist usable for editing of .PO files.

*I encourage anyone willing to do so to backport these changes upstream! I have
a signed Qt Contributor agreement, and I hereby authorize anyone willing to
take my changes to commit them to the official Qt Project codebase, with any
requisite modifications as long as they don't remove the attribution of the
git commit.*

Planned Improvements

1. Build using cmake.

2. Configurable UI fonts.

3. Configurable source path rewrite rules.

Other improvements will be planned as soon as the need arises.

Sidebar

**ALAS**, I don't have the energy to deal with tooling stuck in last century.
I specifically refer to whatever piece of deity-forsaken bovine excrement of
a code review solution the Qt Project chose to use, against all reason (it
seems). Said review system - it-who-shall-not-be-named - is strictly
off-limits to me, because its usability wants me to jump off a bridge,
ideally onto reinforced concrete just to be sure. My will to live has
clearly prevailed, ergo I'm not dealing with that pile of UX excrement.
I leave that to you. Just don't hurt yourself - please and thank you. Be
careful out there!
